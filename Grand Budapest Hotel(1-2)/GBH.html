        <h1>Grand Budapest Hotel</h1>
        <p>
            The Grand Budapest Hotel is a 2014 comedy-drama film written and directed by Wes Anderson, from a story by
            Anderson and Hugo Guinness, inspired by the writings of Stefan Zweig, to whom Anderson wrote the film as a
            tribute.

            Set at the fictional war-torn European country Zubrowka in the 1930s, The Grand Budapest Hotel tells the
            story of two people: Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes), a concierge, one of his employees, the lobby boy
            Zero (Tony Revolori), and the friendship they form as they team up for several misadventures while trying to
            prove Gustave's innocence after he was framed for murder.

            The film is an American-German co-production[2] that was financed by German financial companies and
            film-funding organizations and filmed in Germany.[5][6][7] The Grand Budapest Hotel released to widespread
            critical acclaim and was financially successful, grossing about $175 million worldwide on a $25 million
            budget, and was included in several critics' year-end top-10 lists.[8][9][10][11]

            The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture â€“ Musical or Comedy and garnered three more
            Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Director for Anderson.[12] It was nominated for nine Academy
            Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director for Anderson, and won four Oscars for Best Costume Design,
            Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Production Design and Best Original Score.[13] In a 2016 BBC poll, several
            critics voted the film the 21st greatest film of the 21st century since 2000.
